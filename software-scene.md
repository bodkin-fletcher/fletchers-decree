# Software Scene

This document provides an in-depth look at the technologies outlined in Fletcher's Decree, offering insights into their broad usage, support, and competitive landscape. It serves as a reference for understanding why these tools were selected and how they compare to alternatives in the industry.

## Core Technologies

### Node.js v22.11.0

**Description:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side and networking applications.

**Broad Usage:** Node.js is one of the most widely adopted runtimes, powering millions of websites and applications globally. It's used by major companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, Uber, and PayPal for its non-blocking I/O model, which is ideal for scalable applications.

**Support:** Maintained by the Node.js Foundation, it has a large community of contributors, extensive documentation, and regular updates, including long-term support (LTS) versions for stability.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** Deno is a newer alternative with built-in TypeScript support, but its adoption is limited compared to Node.js's mature ecosystem. Ruby on Rails is simpler for rapid development but lacks Node.js's performance for high-concurrency scenarios. Node.js is chosen for its proven reliability, scalability, and extensive library support.

### Yarn 4.5.2

**Description:** Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript, offering speed, security, and reliability in managing dependencies.

**Broad Usage:** While npm holds a larger market share, Yarn is widely used for its deterministic dependency resolution and "Zero Installs" feature, which enables offline development by caching dependencies locally.

**Support:** Developed by Facebook and supported by a strong community, Yarn has robust documentation and active maintenance, with contributions from major tech companies.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** npm is the default package manager for Node.js, dominating due to its ubiquity. pnpm is gaining traction for its disk efficiency. Yarn is selected for its performance, offline capabilities, and consistency across environments.

## Backend Technologies

### Fastify v4.28.1

**Description:** Fastify is a high-performance web framework for Node.js, focused on speed and low overhead.

**Broad Usage:** Fastify is gaining traction, with nearly 10 million monthly downloads and adoption by companies like Uber and PayPal for its efficiency in handling high request volumes.

**Support:** Actively developed with a strong community, Fastify offers comprehensive documentation, a robust plugin ecosystem, and TypeScript support.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** Express is the most widely used Node.js framework, valued for its simplicity. Koa and NestJS are other alternatives, but Fastify's superior performance (up to 76,000 requests per second) makes it ideal for high-traffic APIs.

## Frontend Technologies

### React

**Description:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

**Broad Usage:** React is the leading UI framework, used by millions of developers and companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Netflix. It's the most in-demand framework in many markets due to its component-based architecture.

**Support:** Maintained by Meta, React has a massive community, extensive documentation, and frequent updates. Thousands of third-party libraries enhance its functionality.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** Vue.js is popular for its simplicity, Angular for enterprise applications, and Svelte for its compile-time approach. React's flexibility, ecosystem, and developer adoption make it the top choice for scalable UIs.

### Vite

**Description:** Vite is a modern build tool for frontend development, offering fast development servers and optimized builds.

**Broad Usage:** Vite is rapidly gaining adoption, recommended by frameworks like Vue 3 and SvelteKit, and increasingly used for React projects over Create React App.

**Support:** Developed by Evan You (Vue.js creator), Vite has a strong community, comprehensive documentation, and an extensible plugin API.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** Webpack is the most mature build tool but is slower. Parcel offers simplicity but fewer features. Vite's speed and modern development experience make it a strong choice.

### Material-UI

**Description:** Material-UI is a React component library implementing Google's Material Design.

**Broad Usage:** One of the most popular React component libraries, with over 3.8 million weekly downloads and use by companies like IBM and Airbnb.

**Support:** Actively maintained by MUI, it offers comprehensive documentation, a large community, and both free and premium offerings.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** Ant Design is popular for enterprise applications, Chakra UI for simplicity, and React Bootstrap for Bootstrap integration. Material-UI's extensive components and Material Design focus make it a top choice.

## Development Tools (Trialed, not confirmed)

### Nodemon v3.1.10

**Description:** Nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in Node.js applications and automatically restarts the server.

**Broad Usage:** Widely used in Node.js development, included in over 6,700 npm projects for its live reloading capabilities.

**Support:** Nodemon has a strong community, with regular updates and clear documentation. Support is available through GitHub and developer forums.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** Node.js has a built-in watch mode, but it's limited compared to Nodemon's features.

### ESLint-Watch

**Description:** ESLint-Watch extends ESLint with file-watching capabilities for real-time linting feedback.

**Broad Usage:** Less common than ESLint itself, with 136,203 weekly downloads, used by developers preferring command-line linting.

**Support:** It benefits from the broader ESLint ecosystem and community, though its niche use limits its prominence.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** ESLint IDE integrations are more commonly used for real-time linting.

### Concurrently

**Description:** Concurrently is a utility to run multiple commands concurrently.

**Broad Usage:** Popular for managing parallel tasks in development, used by 1,901 npm projects.

**Support:** Actively maintained with good documentation and community support via GitHub.

**Competitors/Alternatives:** npm-run-all and npm-watch are alternatives, but Concurrently is straightforward for running multiple commands simultaneously.
