## Technology Descriptions

### Core Technologies

* **Node.js v22.11.0 (Runtime Environment)**\
  A robust JavaScript runtime with a broad ecosystem, supporting both backend and frontend development. It is widely adopted across the industry, powering numerous high-traffic applications, and benefits from extensive community support and regular updates.

* **Yarn 4.5.2 (Package Manager)**\
  A consistent package manager with efficient caching for reliable dependency management. It is a popular choice among developers for its speed, deterministic installs, and "Zero Installs" feature, which enables offline development by caching dependencies locally. Yarn has strong community backing and active maintenance.

### Backend Technologies

* **Fastify v4.28.1 (Web Framework)**\
  A high-performance Node.js framework tailored for building effective APIs. While not the most widely used framework, it is gaining traction for its speed and low overhead, with growing community support and active development.

### Frontend Technologies

* **React (UI Framework)**\
  A library for creating modular, reusable user interfaces with a component-based approach. It is the leading UI framework, widely adopted by developers and companies alike, and is supported by a vast ecosystem and frequent updates.

* **Vite (Build Tool)**\
  A rapid build tool featuring Hot Module Replacement, designed for streamlined workflows. It is rapidly rising in popularity, especially for modern frontend projects, and is actively developed with strong community engagement.

* **Material-UI (Component Library)**\
  A React library providing customizable components to simplify UI development. It is one of the most popular React component libraries, used by many organizations, and is actively maintained with comprehensive documentation.

### Development Tools (Trialed, not confirmed)

* **Nodemon v3.1.10 (Live Reloading)**\
  Restarts the Node.js server on file changes, improving backend development efficiency. It is a well-known tool in the Node.js community, with solid support and active use.

* **ESLint-Watch (Linting)**\
  Offers real-time linting to uphold code quality during development. While not as commonly used as other linting tools, it benefits from the broader ESLint ecosystem and community.

* **Concurrently (Task Runner)**\
  Enables simultaneous execution of multiple commands, aiding task management. It is a popular utility for managing parallel tasks in development, with good documentation and community support.
